Good Morning, Siwaphiwe!<br><br>

On this Wednesday morning, may God surround your day with peace, warmth, and gentle blessings.<br>
May your path be light, may your heart stay steady, and may every moment unfold with a touch of grace.<br>
I pray that whatever you do today works in your favour, and that positivity quietly follows you everywhere you go.<br><br>

Whatever challenges come your way, may you rise above them with strength, calmness, and confidence.<br>
You deserve a day as lovely, soft, and beautiful as you are.<br><br>

Wishing you smiles, courage, and small victories throughout the day.<br><br>

Oh, and apparently FNB has those funny-looking big boxes called ATMs - the ones that are always "mysteriously" filled with free money.<br>
So… let's test that theory today. Pick any one of them.<br>
A little birdie whispered that there are a few notes inside with your name on them, just for your snacks.<br><br>

And if your snacks betray you and cost more…<br>
please forward the bill to the gentleman who sent this — clearly he's terrible at Girl Math, so let him fix it.<br><br>
